## Scoring Guide

### Step 1: Calculate Your Scores

**For Questions 1-18**, assign points as follows:

- Never = 0 points
- Rarely = 1 point
- Sometimes = 2 points
- Often = 3 points
- Very Often = 4 points

**Inattention Subscale Score** (Questions 1-9): _____ / 36

**Hyperactivity-Impulsivity Subscale Score** (Questions 10-18): _____ / 36

**Total ADHD Score** (Questions 1-18): _____ / 72

***

### Step 2: Interpret Your Results

#### **Screening Result:**

**Total Score Interpretation:**

- **0-13 points**: Low likelihood of ADHD
- **14-23 points**: Possible ADHD - consider professional evaluation
- **24-35 points**: High likelihood of ADHD - professional evaluation recommended
- **36+ points**: Very high likelihood of ADHD - professional evaluation strongly recommended


#### **ADHD Type Determination:**

Based on your subscale scores and the diagnostic criteria, your presentation may be:

**Predominantly Inattentive Type:**

- Inattention Score: ≥15 points (indicating 5+ symptoms often/very often)
- Hyperactivity-Impulsivity Score: <15 points
- **Characteristics**: Difficulty focusing, easily distracted, forgetful, poor organization, trouble completing tasks, misses details

**Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type:**

- Hyperactivity-Impulsivity Score: ≥15 points
- Inattention Score: <15 points
- **Characteristics**: Restlessness, fidgeting, excessive talking, difficulty waiting, impulsive decisions, interrupting others

**Combined Type:**

- Inattention Score: ≥15 points AND
- Hyperactivity-Impulsivity Score: ≥15 points
- **Characteristics**: Mix of both inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms
- **Note**: This is the most common type of ADHD, affecting approximately 70% of adults with ADHD[^9]

***

### Step 3: Essential Diagnostic Criteria

For a clinical ADHD diagnosis, the following must ALL be true:

✓ **Symptom Duration**: Symptoms present for at least 6 months

✓ **Multiple Settings**: Symptoms occur in 2 or more settings (home, work, school, social situations)

✓ **Functional Impairment**: Symptoms cause significant impairment in daily functioning (Question 19 answer C or D)

✓ **Childhood Onset**: Some symptoms were present before age 12 (Question 20 answer C or D)

✓ **Not Better Explained**: Symptoms are not better explained by another mental health condition (anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, etc.)

If you answered **"Often" or "Very Often"** to 5 or more questions in Section A or B, answered C or D to Question 19, and D to Question 20, you meet the screening criteria for potential ADHD and should seek professional evaluation.

## Next Steps

### If Your Score Suggests ADHD:

1. **Consult a qualified professional**: Only a Clinical Psychologist, Psychiatrist, or Paediatrician can diagnose ADHD
2. **Gather supporting evidence**:
    - Old school report cards or academic records
    - Input from family members about childhood behavior
    - Examples of current functional impairment
    - List of symptoms and when they occur
3. **Comprehensive evaluation**: A proper ADHD assessment includes:
    - Detailed clinical interview
    - Review of developmental history
    - Assessment of current symptoms and impairment
    - Ruling out other conditions
    - Possible rating scales and questionnaires
    - Input from multiple sources when possible
4. **Consider treatment options**: If diagnosed, effective treatments include:
    - Medication (stimulants and non-stimulants)
    - Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
    - Coaching and skills training
    - Lifestyle modifications
    - Workplace or academic accommodations

## Important Notes

**Comorbidities:** 85% of adults with ADHD have at least one other condition, commonly including:

- Anxiety disorders
- Depression
- Learning disabilities
- Substance use disorders
- Sleep disorders

These conditions must be assessed and treated alongside ADHD for optimal outcomes.[^19][^24]

**Gender Differences:** ADHD may present differently:

- **Women/girls**: More likely to have inattentive type, may be underdiagnosed, symptoms may be more subtle
- **Men/boys**: More likely to have hyperactive-impulsive symptoms, often diagnosed earlier

**Limitations:** This screening tool:

- Cannot diagnose ADHD
- May produce false positives (high scores without ADHD)
- Requires professional interpretation
- Must be combined with comprehensive clinical evaluation
- Does not assess for other conditions that may mimic ADHD

***

**Remember**: This quiz is a starting point for self-awareness, not a substitute for professional diagnosis. ADHD is a complex neurodevelopmental condition that requires expert evaluation and individualized treatment.
